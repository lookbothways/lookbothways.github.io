            <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent">
              <p class="style1"><strong>When should I go?</strong></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style1">Quite frankly, any time of the year is great. It is a city  break you’re after, isn’t it? With the occasional stop in a pub, café,  restaurant…? In that case you don’t need to worry too much about monsoons, erupting  volcanoes or any other such problems. Just get yourself ready for the  continental weather.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style1">From experience and talking to people who have been to Prague,  we’ve learned that “I went in February and it was So Cold!!” Yes, if you are  used to the mild-ish UK  weather, you may think it’s cold. We, however look at it this way – there is no  such thing as bad weather, only the wrong clothes. So dress well, check with us  if unsure what to put in your suitcase and you’ll be just fine. We promise.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style1">Every season has something great to offer. The spring is  gorgeous, summer nice and hot, autumn spectacular and the winter crisp. Trust  us, the Mulled wine from the Christmas markets on the Old    Town Square will keep you warm. Just as much as  the nice chilled pint of lager guarantees to cool you down in the heat of the continental summer. <br />
                You see, over there, we thought of everything.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style1">So when should you go? Any time you fancy.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style1"><strong>Is the place available?</strong></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style1">Now there is a good question. Check with us before you book  your flight. Otherwise you may find yourself somewhat disappointed, you see…</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style1"><strong>What is it going to cost me?</strong></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style1">Let me answer this question before you even have a chance to  ask. Yes, we will ask you for a bit of cash. If nothing else, having you there  costs us and so we ask for small contribution. It’s nothing to worry about, I  can promise you that this fancy apartment will work out way cheaper for you  then the hostel across the road.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style1"><strong>How do I get there</strong>?</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style1">The easiest way to get to Prague  is by air. From experience we can recommend a couple of airlines that you would  have heard of before now. Those are:</p>
              <div align="justify">
                <ul type="disc" class="style1">
                  <li><a href="http://www.easyjet.com/en/book/index.asp?WT.srch=1" target="_blank">Easy       Jet</a> because they are usually the cheapest.</li>
                  <li><a href="http://www.britishairways.com/travel/home/public/en_gb" target="_blank">BA</a>       who offer quite a bit more comfort for just a little bit extra.</li>
                  <li><a href="http://www.csa.cz/cs/portal/homepage/cz_homepage.htm" target="_blank"> CSA</a>       (Czech Airlines) are good but you should check their price and compare       with the two airlines above.</li>
                  <li>Another       good place to check out is <a href="http://www.click4sky.com/" target="_blank">www.click4sky.com</a> </li>
                  <li>And       then you have your usual process of googling ‘cheap flights’ which       will give you another half a million options.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <p align="justify" class="style1">In our days of sub zero income we used to travel a lot on  coach but the companies who will take you directly from London to Prague are  slowly disappearing and we are no longer able to recommend any one of the  existing ones. But it’s still worth looking into a bit more if all you have is only  a very little cash. We know of the <a href="http://www.studentagency.cz/" target="_blank">Student Agency</a> and <a href="http://www.eurolines.co.uk/" target="_blank">Eurolines</a> going to Prague. </p>

              <p class="style1"><strong>The common sense ones</strong></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style1">If you are traveling on your UK  passport you should just be able to put it in your pocket and go. If however  you do not have one of those, it’s best to check with the <a href="http://www.mzv.cz/london/" target="_blank">Czech Embassy</a> in London. Conveniently enough, their website will also tell you the current temperature in Prague.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style1">Your little plastic debit card will work just as well over  there as it does here in the UK.  So you don’t need to worry about getting too much cash before you leave the  country. Excellent news, you’ll be saving on commission fees and you don’t need  to guess how much you’re likely to spend. Just get the money out of the cash  machine as and when you need it. <br />
                How much will you get for your UK  pounds? There’s no point in us putting this info online – it has been almost  60Kc to £1 and it has also been about 30Kc to £1.  You see, it tends to change quite a bit. 
                To find out about the latest exchange rates from £ to Kc  (Czech crown / 'Koruna') go to: <a href="http://www.xe.com/" target="_blank">www.xe.com</a></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style1">Now this is the best part – this holiday is one of those  where you need nothing extra. No more jabs that you’d get at home, no malaria  pills, no worries about drinking tap water when you’re over there... It’s all  nice, easy and very civilized.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style1">It may be worth checking out if your travel insurance is  still valid and if you have your free <a href="http://www.ehic-ie.org/apply.html" target="_blank">European Health Card</a>. Just in case. Or  be very careful with combining too much mulled wine when it’s icy out there.  You would not want to fall over and hurt yourself, would you? Having said that,  the healthcare in Czech Republic  is excellent so you’d have nothing to worry about if you did.</p>

              <p align="justify" class="style1"><strong>Your own research</strong></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style1">Of course we will tell you how great the place is. And it’s  not because we want to trick you into anything. We genuinely love Prague and  the Czech Republic so all we tell you is what we really think and feel – the  place is simply great and quite frankly, we don’t really understand why you  haven’t been there already. So that is us.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style1">But there are different views and observations so we  recommend that you also check some of these websites and forums:</p>

            <div class="CollapsiblePanelTab" tabindex="0">Getting around Prague</div>
            <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent">
              <p align="justify" class="style1"><strong>Getting into town from the airport</strong> <strong>&amp;</strong> <strong>getting around the town.</strong></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style1">It could not be easier. First, before you even leave the  airport, get yourself a 3 day or 5 day ticket, depending on how long you plan to  stay. Then hop on bus No119, validate your ticket (in simple English - stick it in the little machine on the bus, it will print the start date and time for you on your ticket) and let it take you to  the last bus stop ‘Dejvicka’, which is also the first stop on the tube. I can tell you with all honesty, the public transport could not be easier. There are only 3 tube lines - you cannot get lost! On top of that buses arrive on time, the tube is more spacious, and the trams are  fun. 
                Unless you’re arriving at the airport in the middle of the  night, you should not need a taxi at all during your stay. This is another  great money saving news for you.<br />
                Same as everything else, the cost of travel changes every so often and so we'd like to recomment that you check the <a href="http://www.dpp.cz/en/" target="_blank">Prague Public Transport</a> website to get the most up to date info on cost and fares. Not to worry, even with prices going up, it will be much cheaper than moving around London. And another useful tip - do get a ticket, even if you don't see other people using theirs (they may have a season pass). You are very likely to be checked and it does sort of spoil the romance if you have to fork out for a fine.<br />
              </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style1"><strong>Getting to the flat</strong></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style1">This is also super-easy. The flat is in a fancy apartment block which is  around the corner from the tube station Palmovka. From the flat to the tube  platform it will take you about 3 minutes.<br />
                Palmovka station is 5 or 6 stops on the tube to the city  centre (depending which part of the city centre you’re heading for).<br />
                What this means is that you will stay in an area that is not  full of tourists but the moment you want to be in town, you need to give  yourself no more than 1/2 hour and you’re there. <br />
              Once we confirm your dates and you get the keys to the flat, we will give you a detailed step by step (literaly!) instructions on how to find the flat. The only people who were not able to find it were... (well, I probably should not but I will tell you)... the couple who left these instructions in London!</p>

              <p align="justify" class="style1">This may happen to you too: every time we go, we have a long  list of Czech delicatessen to work our way through. It’s not easy but it is  possible. You just need to focus and stay away from the touristy places that  will try to re-create your usual English diet. <br />
                You have traveled this far, you may as well go just as far  with your eating adventures.<br />
                Have you ever had fried cheese in bread crumbs? Or what  about dumplings with cabbage and pork? Trying out the traditional foods could  fill your itinerary if you wanted to. We recommend that you don’t hold back and  go for it. Ok, it’s a bit fattening but hey, when will you come back to enjoy  another nice full plate? A week of reasonable eating back in the UK  will put your weight back to normal. It’s been tried and tested many times (and  I am still size 8ish)<br />
                Slight difficulty may arise if you are a vegetarian or even  vegan. There a places that offer more than just a couple of meat-free dishes  but if you stick mainly to the traditional, local Czech pubs and restaurants,  you may not have so much to choose from. We apologies on behalf of all meat  eating Czechs but this is the way it seems to be over there…</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style1"><strong>How to order your food a drink</strong></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style1">When it comes to dining and wining (or drinking beer, which  is just so much more likely) we recommend that you have your phrase book handy  so that you know what it is you’re ordering &amp; that you try a few little  words, at least your ‘please’ and ‘thank you’. We can pretty much guarantee  that the service will go up a notch or two. Throughout  history the Czechs  always had to speak more than just their own language. Recently those have been  mainly German and Russian, and so they will appreciate when you, an English  speaker make a little bit of an effort. <br />
                Go on, don’t by shy. It’s fun. You may even get so much into  it that you’ll end up signing up for a Czech language course at the Czech  centre in London. <br />
              Let me make it even easier for you - my dictionary and phrase book is in the kitchen. Borrow it &amp; use it, ok.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style1"><strong>A few bits about pub etiquette </strong></p>
              <p align="justify"><span class="style1">We will tell you about the traditional places, ok. Not the  fancy, set up for tourist ones. We don’t go to those – ever.<br />
                You can just walk in and take your seat. Always expect to be  served. There is no need to queue at a bar and wait for your drink. It will  come to you. <br />
                If you order a ‘pint’ it will be in fact half a liter that  you get (you will have noticed by now that we don’t do pints, we operate in  metric measurements). The beer will come with a nice big head which will slowly  but surely settle right at the line which tells you where half liter comes to.  Just give it a minute. You are not being short changed. Czech people don’t mess  about when it comes to their beer. It’s a very serious matter, you see.<br />
                Now for the other thing - tipping. It is customary to tip  the person when they present you with a bill. We don’t leave change on the  table when we leave. Let me give you an example. The waitress comes over and tells  you that your bill comes to 153Kc. To this you say ‘170’. She thanks you and  the transaction is done. You round up the number and / or add a bit extra.  That’s all. Nice and simple. Now you've qualified for the Real Czech Pub Experience. Well done.</span></p>

              <p align="justify" class="style1">One of the most romantic cities in Europe,  Prague is culturally diverse &amp;  vibrant; historical city that offers a lot to all visitors.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style1"><strong>The origin of Prague</strong> <br />
                <br />
The origin of Prague goes back  to the 7th century and the Slavic princess Libuše, a woman of great beauty and  wisdom who possessed prophetic powers. Libuše and her husband, prince Přemysl,  ruled peacefully over the Czech lands from the hill of Vyšehrad (BTW a place worth visiting). A legend says  that one day Libuše had a vision. She stood on a cliff overlooking the river Vltava,  pointed to a forested hill across the river, and proclaimed: &quot;I see a  great city whose glory will touch the stars.&quot; (&quot;Vidím město veliké,  jehož sláva hvězd se dotýkati bude.&quot;). She instructed her people to go and  build a castle where a man was building the threshold (in Czech práh) of a  house. &quot;And because even the great noblemen must bow low before a  threshold, you shall give it the name Praha&quot;. Her words were obeyed and  some two hundred years later, the city of Prague  became the seat of the Premyslid dynasty.<br />
                What an excellent story, don’t you think?</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style1">                <strong>Prague today</strong><br />
                <br />
                Here is what the experts say: Prague, the Czech capital (please do not, under any circumstances call it Czechoslovakia and ideally, have a look at the map of Europe to see that calling it Eastern Europe is not the smartest thing either), is  among the fastest-developing and most progressive regions in all of Europe.  Over the past few years, the city has transformed itself from what some seen as  a ‘dreary East Bloc capital’ to a modern European metropolis.<br />
                The 1.3 million-strong capital is among the most visited cities in central Europe  and, understandably, the most popular Czech destination. Prague  is a living textbook of different architectural styles, where Romanesque,  Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque structures stand side by side with examples of  Art Nouveau, Cubist, and functionalist architecture.<br />
                Prague enjoys a vibrant cultural  and social life. Dozens of galleries and museums attract visitors to their  permanent collections and temporary exhibitions, displaying artistic and craft  treasures of all periods and places of origin. Even if this is not exactly your  cup of tea, it’s worth going to at least one exhibition.<br />
                And what do we say about Prague today? It's brilliant, beautiful and it has a soul. It's a place you'll love forever.<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Dangers and annoyances</strong></p>
              <p align="justify" class="style1">Are you arriving to Prague  from London? Well then you will be  surprised how peaceful and quiet the city is (unless, of course you bump into  a hen or stag do which flew in on the same plane). You can slow down a bit but it  doesn’t mean that you should forget to pay attention to what’s going on around  you.<br />
                The most likely thing is that someone will try to pickpocket  you. This is a city, and so sadly, it is somewhat to be expected. Just keep  an eye on your bag and you’ll be fine. 
                We have not heard of any other kinds of incidents and it’s highly  unlikely that anything worse will happen to you. 
                Feeling relieved? Good, so are we.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style1">Since I mentioned 'peaceful and quiet' - please try to keep those two words in mind when you're arriving at the flat late at night, having spent the day out, enjoying yourself. You're on holiday, we know. But the chance is that most of the people around you aren't and are in fact getting up very early to go to work.</p>

            <div class="CollapsiblePanelTab" tabindex="0">What is there to do and see?</div>
            <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent">
              <p align="justify" class="style1">You can start with the most obvious activity - city walks  and sightseeing. Especially if this is your first time in the Czech   Republic, this is where you need to  start. <br />
                Enjoy the Old Town Square,  be careful not to hurt your neck as you check out the astronomical clock, stop  for a concert, look at the shops on Wenceslas Square,  walk to the river, cross over Charles   Bridge, walk up the hill through  Mala Strana to the Castle and see the cathedral 'Sv Vita' there. Most definitely have  your camera ready to take some snaps of the red rooftops. Take the cable car  to the top to Petrin Hill and walk up the little 'Eiffel'   Tower and wonder around the Mirror Maze, and then down the hill,  enjoying the greenery around you. Just go wherever you see something pretty,  something worth taking a picture of. If you do nothing else but follow this one  piece of advice, you’re guaranteed to keep walking for a good couple of days at  least.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style1">Please note that it's worth your time to chek out opening times online, before you actually go to see something. There is small chance that not everything will be open just when you need it. We have been told that the mini Eiffel Tower and the Mirror Maze on top of Petrin Hill have restricted opening hours in winter. Try the <a href="http://pis.cz/en" target="_blank">Prague Inforamtion Service</a> site for more up to date info.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style1"><strong>Don't get hungry</strong><br />
              Another one of the reasons why you're travelling to Prague is to enjoy the food and drink, right? Have a pint in the Staropramen Brewery Pub or just any Czech lager anywhere you fancy. Do you prefer Bernard, Gambrinus, Plzen, 'Star', Svijany or a pint of the original Budvar? Whichever one it is, you are probably about 5minutes away from it.<br />
              Czech traditional food is another thing you will remember for a long time - did you ever realise how much you can eat in one holiday? No, you didn't but you're about to. Wander around and try whatver you fancy. 'Goulash', dumplings, fried cheese... a lot of yummy (often fried) food. Enjoy!</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style1"><strong>High brow culture</strong><br />
                Whilst you’re at it, walking your feet off, you can stop for a concert or perhaps  even an opera at the <a href="http://www.narodni-divadlo.cz/Default.aspx?jz=en" target="_blank">National Theatre</a>. We love to do that. The price you pay  for your tickets is half of what you’d pay for the same performance in London.  The theater has a great history &amp; the performances and simply wonderful. If  your concern is not understanding, than you need to worry no more – each opera  will have subtitles in both English and German. Easy.<br />
                After the show you might want to pop into ‘<a href="http://www.kmotra.cz/en" target="_blank">Kmotra</a>’, the famous  pizzeria just around the corner from the National Theatre. There you are likely  to sit at the table next to the one with all the stars. We got to see Mr  Nutcracker there much better than we got to see him from our fancy seats at the  ballet. </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style1"><strong>Museums</strong><br />
                Plenty of those around so just have your pick. I personally  very much like the <a href="http://www.ntm.cz/en" target="_blank">Technical museum</a>. Old trains, planes, automobiles… and then  all those technical things I simply don’t understand that well. Fascinating place to  visit.<br />
                Our guests also recommended the main Museum on the top of Wenceslas Square ('Vaclavske namesti') and with that issues a warning - you will need a full day to see the whole place. Chose just one or two subjects and get out after a couple of hours. There is so much more to see. <br />
                Czech republic  has a rich history and so whichever aspect of it interests you, you can find  out more by visiting one of the many museum. 
                Just do your research before you go to be sure that it’s  open on the day you want to go. Most places used to close on Mondays but that  might have changed.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style1"><strong>River cruise</strong><br />
                Here comes the big confession – we have never been on a  river cruise in Prague but some of  our English friends do recommend it as a romantic thing to do. </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style1"><strong>Movie buff?</strong><br />
                You will not miss on any of the movies that will be on in  the UK whilst  you’re away. You can see the film that you’ve been waiting for and what’s even  better, for about half the price again. Isn’t it just great? 
                What’s even better is that it's pretty likely that you might  be able to ‘czech out’ some of the locations. Mission Impossible, Bourne Identity, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Hellboy,  xXx, Blade 1&amp;2, Amadeus, The Illusionist, Kolya, Oliver Twist, Les Miserables, Faust and many others.<br />
                If you are up for a day trip you can see where one of the  latest Bond movies was filmed. A couple of hours scenic train journey and you  are there - <a href="http://www.karlovy-vary.cz/en/" target="_blank">Karlovy Vary</a>, a  gorgeous palce.<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Prague ZOO – something  special</strong><br />
I guess that you are most likely not going for this city break  with a little kid but whether you are or you are not, the <a href="http://www.zoopraha.cz/en" target="_blank">Prague ZOO</a> is one of  the places we visit pretty much every time we are there long enough to spare a  day. 
                It is simply fabulous. Oh go on - we know you always wanted to visit a bat cave...</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style1"><strong>Sights outside of the  city</strong><br />
                There are some wonderful <strong>spas</strong> within no more than a couple of hours coach or train ride from  Prague. If you are staying long  enough, those are well worth visiting.<br />
                Another good idea for a day trip out of Prague  is a visit to one of the many <strong>castles</strong> or chateaus. The most famous ones are on offer with any tour operator in the  city. However, since we use public transport, we recommend that you do the  same. Save a bit of cash, stay as long as you want to and leave behind the  other tourists. You didn’t come here to hang out with other foreigners, did you?</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style1"><strong>Sports fan?</strong><br />
                  <br />
                    <strong>Football</strong><br />
              Well, there are a few options here. You can go and see one  of the local football matches. We support <a href="http://www.slavia.cz/index_en.asp" target="_blank">Slavia</a>. Our ‘enemies’ are Sparta  and I guess the best match you can get is when those two teams play each other.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style1"><strong>Running</strong><br />
              If you are into running (and I know that quite a few of  you, my friends, are), you can take part in the Prague International <a href="http://www.praguemarathon.com/en" target="_blank">Marathon</a>  (usually May) or any other similar event. And if you’re not too sure about being able to make it but you  still like to run, you can try something else – for example the 'Prague Relative  10k'. This run is particularly great if you like running and also enjoy good  beer, all at the same time. The way it works is quite funny: you are given the  opportunity to have one large beer (0.5l) four times during the race. For every  beer you have, your final time gets improved. You see, being all skinny and  healthy is all good, but here it’s a different thing all together. This race  welcomes beer drinkers. Bizarre, right. And I hear it’s a lot of fun too.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style1"><strong>Skiing</strong><br />
                The whole of the Czech    republic is surrounded by mountains. So just  have your pick which way you fancy going skiing. We recommend hoping on the  tube to 'Cerny Most' station and from there taking the coach which will (for  a few quid / in about 2hrs) get you to a ski resort. There you can hire all the  stuff you need and enjoy the snow. <br />
                Do you remember last time you saw proper snow in the UK?  Well, there you go. 
                Again, as you are earning in UK  pounds, the cost of a few days skiing will be something you will tell you  friends about - ‘cheap as chips mate!’</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style1"><strong>Rock climbing</strong><br />
                Ok, if you are a proper hard-core climber and can’t leave  the wall for a day or two but your girlfriend so wants to go for this city  break, here is your good news. Two streets away from us is a climbing wall and just a tram ride away is the <a href="http://www.boulder.cz/bb/struktura.php?stid=13" target="_blank">Boulder Bar</a>.<br />
                And if you are both keen climbers, it gets even better. Do  you remember what I said in the skiing chapter? Mountains, mountains everywhere. Proper  mountains, not just peaks. You’ll love them. Start with a couple of days in Prague,  then head out to the countryside and have fun.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style1"><strong>Hiking, trekking and mountain biking</strong><br />
                I am going to take you back to the mountains that I  mentioned above. You can have a wonderful time there. We have been to places  where we’ve met just a handful of people during an entire day of walking.  Peace, quiet, greenery. Anything else you can ask for? Sure, a couple of days  in Prague before you set of.<br />
                Any recommendations or challenges? Yes, try to get to the peak   of Snezka, the tallest of all Czech  mountains, 1602meters (now, try converting this into feet… and… now you’re  impressed, right)</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style1"><strong>Camping</strong><br />
                <span class="style1">And if you are a proper  adventurer (or a budget holiday maker with some sense for adventure), here is  another suggestion – camping holiday in Czech.  We do not have a seaside but the numerous lakes compensate for this perfectly.  Woods behind you, gorgeous lake in front of you, clean air, the birds are  singing… what else do you want? The weather is pretty much guaranteed  (unlike the gamble you need to take in the UK  every July).<br />
                In some places you can hire  kayaks, boats; you can even have a go at windsurfing. Frankly, whatever you  want, you can  find it.                </span>              </p>
              <div>
                <p align="justify" class="style1">I like these suggestions. But  where exactly do I go?<br />
    If you are stuck with your  googling, just let us know. We will be quite happy to give you a few names of  places that might be the right thing for you or at least to point you in the  right direction and get your holiday planning back on track.</p>

              'Lofty Palmovka' is a new development in one of Prague's central districts, only   a few metro stops from the city centre.</p>
            <p align="justify" class="style1"><strong>The building and its location</strong>              </p>
            <p align="justify" class="style1">This three-storey former brick factory dates from the 19th century. The   original structure has been preserved and is unique: its high ceilings, big   windows, impressive arches and wooden beams go so well together, creating a   genuinely unique environment.</p>
            <p align="justify" class="style1">The building is within 2 minutes walking distance from the nearest tube,   Palmovka, which in turn is within a few stops on the tube from many historic   sites and places of interest that you may like to visit while in Prague.</p>
            <p align="justify" class="style1">Even though the building is close to the local amenities, it is set back from   the main road &amp; our apartment faces a private courtyard, guaranteeing a   peaceful night in.</p>
            <p align="justify" class="style1"><strong>The district</strong></p>
            <p align="justify" class="style1">Palmovka has a riverside park with a beautiful chateau which is only 10   minutes walk. Here you can find a quiet space to enjoy, away from the vibrant   city centre.</p>
            <p align="justify" class="style1">The area also offers a great range of pubs, bars and restaurants, much   cheaper than those in the city centre. You can find the perfect breakfast in the   local bakery &amp; in the evenings try traditional Czech food or opt for pizza   if you feel less adventurous. And of course, there's always the option to cook   in the apartment as there are many shops and some larger supermarkets near the   tube station.</p>
            <p align="justify"><span class="style1">The recently built '<a href="http://www.o2arena.cz/O2arenaEN/default.aspx" target="_blank">O2 Arena</a>' (previously known as Sazka Arena) is only 15 minutes walk and it is the   location of many interesting events.</span><br />

            We've left some coffee, sugar and cream for the flat, hope you don't mind<br />

  We've had a lovely holiday. The flat is light, airy and very comfortable. Travel by metro and tram is very quick and easy. Prague is an amazing city with yet more fantastic buildings round every corner. We've spent quite a lot of our time in the beautiful gardens as the weather has been warm and sunny every day. 
              We've left some restaurant cards with recommendations / comments for future visitors. 
              Thank you for your hospitality<br />

              Thank you for letting John and me stay for a week in your lovely flat, Radka. We have been very comfortable here. 
              We have enjoyed Prague very much and have found the Czech people very helpful and friendly. We have traveled by metro every day and I have been absolutely astounded on several occasions when men and young people have stood up and offered me their seats. That's not how we do things these days in the jolly old United Kingdom, I am very much afraid. So it was delightful to realise that courtesy still matters in the Czech Republic. 
              We found the local supermarket, Delvita, more than adequate for our requirement and would strongly recommend the restaurant Kolkovna at V Kolkovne.<br />

              Dear Radka, 
              Prague is beautiful &amp; idyllic We enjoyed the slow pace of life here and found the people warm and welcoming. 
              We loved it and we thank you for allowing us to be in your home. 
              We hope to come back. Best wishes<br />

  Dear Radka, 
              thank you so much for letting us stay at your lovely home. We both had a great time  in Prague. We were impressed with the selection of things to do - we visited the ZOO and it was a great day out. 
              We enjoyed all the meals we had and food was of a high standard and very reasonable. Debbie tried the ghoulash and potato soup (served in a loaf of bread!) and we both tried the apple strudel - all of these were lovely. 
              We have walked our feet off! 
              Thanks again<br />

  Dear Radka. Wow, what a beautiful city. There is so much to see, around every corner another church, museum, cathedral. Such beautiful buildings. Kutna Hora was a wonderful day trip - by bus, you see so much of the countryside. 
              Your apartment has been so welcoming. 
              Thank you so much for letting us stay here.<br />

              Thank you for letting us stay in your lovely apartment. 
              We had a fabulous four days over Easter in this beautiful city!! 
              We would recommend the tour of Kutna Hora where you visit the world famous 'bone' church &amp; the magnificent St Barbara's cathedral. We also enjoyed a fabulous night at the marionette theatre where we saw 'Don Giovanni'. 
              For those on diets we would recommend only the seafood diet this weekend... see food &amp; eat it!!! 
              We are all leaving with bellies full of glonous Czech food! Thanks again. Cheers<br />

            I guess your only question now is: &quot;Can I stay with you guys?&quot;</p>
          <p align="justify" class="style1">You can contact us via e-mail: <a href="mailto:radka.bailey@gmail.com">radka.bailey@gmail.com</a> Just allow a bit of time for an answer - if we are sunning ourselves in Thailand or doing anything else that is so much more exciting than the usual 9-5 (oh I wish!) we may not be able to get to our e-mail for a few days, a week at the most.<br />
